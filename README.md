# Introduction
This dataset was retrieved on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raminhuseyn/dataset-from-tiktok. I had been in the process of finding an appropriate dataset in efforts to aid me in learning Power BI. This dataset was deemed a successful candidate, as my goal was to achieve a successful analysis uncovering potential business benefits while also experimenting with the data visualization capabilities. This dataset contains enough categorical and numerical data providing me the ability to explore the functionalities of Power BI such as Power Query and discovering insights within the data.
The goal of this data is to determine whether the TikTok user made a claim of a statement or provided their opinion. Being provided with both categorical data and numerical data allows users to explore multiple prediction methods, whether it be a regression model on the numerical data or a deep learning LLM model using the categorical data. In this report here, I will be exploring a multiple regression method while Iâ€™ll be leaving the opportunity to explore this data with an LLM as future considerations.

# The Data

 - Verified_status: A binary choice of options. Not verified, where the TikTok creator is not a verified account. Verified, the TikTok creator is a verified account.
